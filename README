This library is to be used for parsing, searching, and scraping the uoguelph
academic calendar:
    (http://www.uoguelph.ca/registrar/calendars/index.cfm?undergraduate)

Here is an example of using the library:

import courseparser
cp = courseparser.CourseParser()
cp.get_course(2011, "cis2750", CourseParser.UNDERGRADUATE_CALENDAR)

This will fetch a fresh copy from the undergraduate academic calendar and return a
dictionary containing the following information:

* Course Code
* Course Number
* Course Department
* Course Description
* Course Restrictions
* Course Prequiesits
* Course Title
* Course Semesters Offered
* Course Credit Value

You can further specify which academic calendar you want to fetch data from.
Currently supported are:

* Undergraduate (UNDERGRADUATE_CALENDAR)
* Graduate (GRADUATE_CALENDAR)
* Associate Diploma (DIPLOMA_CALENDAR)
* Guelph Humber (GUELPHHUMBER_CALENDAR)

There also exists a caching mechanism so you don't hit the server every time.
The last parameter in get_course (True/False) specifies whether or not to fetch
a fresh copy (defaults to False).

** TODO **
1. Grab all courses available for a specific program
2. Grab all courses available for a specific year
